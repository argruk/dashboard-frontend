# dashboard-frontend

To have an application working, you also need to install two other projects:
1. [Server](https://github.com/argruk/thesis-toolset-backend)
2. [Data function](https://github.com/argruk/thesis-dashboard-data-function)

This is the repository for a client in the thesis: "Data acquisition and preparation toolbox
for Cumulocity-based solutions".

## Installing and running the application:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/argruk/dashboard-frontend.git`.
2. Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) version 8.3.0 installed.
3. Install necessary packages: `npm i`.
4. Run the application: `npm start`
